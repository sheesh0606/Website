    <p>This mountain, while being a lesser-known location, has a certain something special and impressive about it. With its alluring bird's eye views of the city and metro Cebu, this peak in Pangilatan will fascinate you. You can see the ships, the boardwalk, and even the Minglanilla traffic issue vividly from the viewpoint above.</p>

Since Pangilatan Peak isn’t really known (even to locals), it is suggested that you show a picture of it. In addition, tell the locals that you’re heading to Cantao-an or Mount Magdook.  Once you arrive at the crossing, head left, and make your way up to Pangilatan Peak.</p>
